# MultiAddonManager

A MetaMod plugin that allows you to use multiple workshop addons at once and have clients download them.

**NOTE:** The server will *not* actually mount the extra addon(s) so you will have to extract their content into the server's files. Most notably, player models will have broken animations unless you do this.
## Installation

- Install [Metamod](https://cs2.poggu.me/metamod/installation/)
- Download the [latest release package](https://github.com/Source2ZE/MultiAddonManager/releases/latest) for your OS
- Extract the package contents into `game/csgo` on your server
- Edit the config file at `game/csgo/cfg/multiaddonmanager/multiaddonmanager.cfg`
